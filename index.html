        <h2>Sun</h2>
        <p>
          The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component. Its large mass,
          which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System, produces temperatures and
          densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium,
          making it a main-sequence star. This releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly
          radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.

        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        <p>
          Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and on average, all seven other planets. The
          smallest planet in the Solar System, Mercury has no natural satellites. Besides impact
          craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably
          produced by a period of contraction early in its history. Mercury's very tenuous
          atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Its relatively
          large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained. Hypotheses include
          that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact, or that it was prevented from
          fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.

      <article>
        <h2>Venus</h2>
        <p>
          Venus is close in size to Earth and, like Earth, has a thick silicate mantle around an
          iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity. It is
          much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus has no natural
          satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752 °F), most
          likely due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. No definitive evidence of
          current geological activity has been detected on Venus, but it has no magnetic field that
          would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere
          is being replenished by volcanic eruptions.

      <article>
        <h2>Earth</h2>
        <p>
          Earth is the largest and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have current
          geological activity, and the only place where life is known to exist. Its liquid
          hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate
          tectonics has been observed. Earth's atmosphere is radically different from those of the
          other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen. It
          has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in
          the Solar System.

      <article>
        <h2>Mars</h2>
        <p>
          Mars is smaller than Earth and Venus. It has an atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a
          surface pressure of 6.1 millibars. Its surface, peppered with vast volcanoes, such as
          Olympus Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that
          may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago. Its red colour comes from
          iron oxide (rust) in its soil. Mars has two tiny natural satellites (Deimos and Phobos)
          thought to be either captured asteroids, or ejected debris from a massive impact early in
          Mars's history.

      <article>
        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        <p>
          Jupiter, is 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets put together. It is composed
          largely of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates semi-permanent
          features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red Spot. Jupiter has 79
          known satellites. The four largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, show similarities
          to the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and internal heating. Ganymede, the largest
          satellite in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury.

        <h2>Saturn</h2>
        <p>
          Saturn, distinguished by its extensive ring system, has several similarities to Jupiter,
          such as its atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% of
          Jupiter's volume, it is less than a third as massive. Saturn is the only planet of the
          Solar System that is less dense than water. The rings of Saturn are made up of small ice
          and rock particles. Saturn has 82 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of
          these, Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological activity. Titan, the second-largest
          moon in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury and the only satellite in the Solar
          System with a substantial atmosphere.

      <article>
        <h2>Uranus</h2>
        <p>
          Uranus is the lightest of the outer planets. Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun
          on its side; its axial tilt is over ninety degrees to the ecliptic. It has a much colder
          core than the other giant planets and radiates very little heat into space. Uranus has 27
          known satellites, the largest ones being Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda.

      <article>
        <h2>Neptune</h2>
        <p>
          Neptune, though slightly smaller than Uranus, is more massive and hence more dense. It
          radiates more internal heat, but not as much as Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune has 14 known
          satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with geysers of liquid nitrogen.
          Triton is the only large satellite with a retrograde orbit. Neptune is accompanied in its
          orbit by several minor planets, termed Neptune trojans, that are in 1:1 resonance with it.
